So, [A Bit Better RTM][] makes some _great_ improvements to [Remember the Milk][], which is awesome in it's own right. It also appears to be unmaintained.

Could it be better?

I think so!

So here's my efforts to make it that way.

The project started as an attempt to remove the tab view completely rather than simply re-locate it the left. The vast majority of the time, you don't need the tab view at all.

Roadmap wise:

1. I'd like to have a tree view of the tabs that would honor `.`ed notation as a folder structure. I have a naming strategy I follow for all my lists to make them easy to organize and jump to that would possibly be nice to navigate in this way.

2. I'd like to pop the quick add view into it's own module so that I can quick add lists without having to display tabs to the left. (Think the box that pops up to go to list or move to list but that it would add a list instead.)

3. I'd like fuzzy matching in Go to List and Move to List.

Any other ideas, please open an [Issue][].
